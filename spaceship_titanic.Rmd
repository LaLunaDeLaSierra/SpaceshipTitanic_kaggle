```{r}
shiptest <- read.csv("test.csv")

length(shiptrain$Transported[shiptrain$Transported == "False"]) / length(shiptrain$Transported)
```

Our response variable is Transported, denoted True or False. Transported is True 50.36% of the time and false 49.64% of the time. 

```{r}
# convert to factor for glm 
shiptrain <- shiptrain %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor))

head(shiptrain)
```
```{r}
glmshiptrain <- glm(Transported ~ . - PassengerId - Transported, data = shiptrain, family = binomial())
summary(glmshiptrain)
